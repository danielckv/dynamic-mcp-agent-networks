# dynamic-mcp-agent-networks

A powerful cross-platform agent that automatically discovers and monitors network services in your infrastructure. This tool scans your network for APIs, endpoints, logs, and other services, then generates MCP (Model Context Protocol) connectors for seamless integration with your monitoring and modeling systems.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Service Discovery**: Scans networks to identify APIs, databases, log sources, message queues, and other services
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other UNIX-like systems
- **Multiple Discovery Methods**: Uses port scanning, mDNS, and UPnP to find all available services
- **Intelligent Service Classification**: Automatically determines service types and appropriate monitoring configurations
- **Customizable Configuration**: Fine-tune scanning parameters, network ranges, and connector settings
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Built in Rust for maximum performance with minimal resource usage
- **Easy Integration**: Generates standardized Model Context Protocol connector files that work with existing modeling platforms

Perfect for DevOps teams, system administrators, and anyone who needs comprehensive visibility into their network infrastructure for modeling and contextual understanding of their systems.

# dynamic-mcp-agent-networks

This tool scans your network for APIs, endpoints, logs, and other services, then generates MCP (Model Context Protocol) connectors for seamless integration with other providers.
The tool is running locally on the host's machine to lookup for any kind of endpoints/APIs that could be part of the user's service solution.

## Key Features

-   **Automatic Service Discovery**: Scans networks to identify APIs, databases, log sources, message queues, and other services
-   **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and other UNIX-like systems
-   **Multiple Discovery Methods**: Uses port scanning, mDNS, and UPnP to find all available services
-   **Intelligent Service Classification**: Automatically determines service types and appropriate monitoring configurations
-   **Customizable Configuration**: Fine-tune scanning parameters, network ranges, and connector settings
-   **Lightweight and Efficient**: Built in Rust for maximum performance with minimal resource usage
-   **Easy Integration**: Generates standardized connector files that work with existing monitoring platforms using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Perfect for DevOps teams, system administrators, and anyone who needs comprehensive visibility into their network infrastructure.
